# 20 Questions
A terminal based 20 questions game, using a binary tree to "learn" from previous
games played. This was a project for my CS145 class at Green River Community 
College in the Fall of 2016. The teacher provided the files: UserInterface.java,
animals.txt, and question1.txt. I worte the files: QuestionMain.java, 
QuestionTree.java, QuestionTreeNode.java and question2.txt.

# Running 20 Questions:
First Download and compile the project. Next Run the main method found in 
QuestionMain.java and follow the prompts in the terminal. You can either start 
a fresh game where the computer will not know anything and you must teach him by
playing the game several times. Or you can load a previously played game or one 
of the supplied question lists by providing the file name and the .txt file type
When you are finished playing the program will tell you how many games were 
played and how may times it was able to guess your object. You can save what the
computer has "leaned" durring the game by providing it with a file name and file
type to save the information to.
